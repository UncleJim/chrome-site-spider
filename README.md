This Chrome extension is a client-side web spider. Start it on a page and it will follow every link. Use a regular expression leash to restrict its depth. The result is a table listing every URL it found, along with the HTTP status code and MIME type.

For more information and to install ***the original extension***, visit its page at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ddlodfbcplakmddhdlffebcggbbighda).
